# Instruction Page Styling Guidelines

Use this checklist when building or updating instruction pages so they match the Email Practice layout shown in the reference screenshot.

## Layout
- Center the content on the page with a constrained max width (about 640px) and comfortable vertical margin.
- Place a subtle container or card with rounded corners and a soft shadow around the content.
- Keep the icon at the top, followed by the page title, supporting description, task panel, and primary action button.

## Typography
- Use the same sans-serif font stack as the rest of the apps (e.g., Inter, "Segoe UI", system UI, sans-serif).
- Center-align the heading and supporting text.
- Task list items should use the base body text size and line-height.

## Color and emphasis
- Page background: light gray (#f6f7fb or similar) to contrast with the white card.
- Card background: white.
- Task panel: soft gray fill (#f2f2f2) with left alignment and no border.
- Primary button: solid blue (#0d6efd) with white text.
- Heading and body text: dark neutral (#212529), matching the screenshot.
- Keep shadows and borders subtle to maintain a clean, modern look.

## Spacing
- Generous padding inside the card (roughly 24–32px) and consistent spacing between sections: icon, heading, description, task panel, and button.
- Provide comfortable line spacing for list items and enough gap before the primary button to separate it from the task text.

## Interaction
- The primary action button should span only the width needed by its label, centered under the task panel.
- Keep hover/focus styles consistent with the existing button system styles.

These guidelines ensure all instruction pages use the same layout, font, and color scheme as the reference design.
