# Outlook Simulation

A quick triage exercise that mimics an Outlook inbox. Process 20 preset messages and decide whether to delete, archive, or take action on each one. Your accuracy, total time, and average speed are summarized at the end.

## How to use

1. Click **Start Assessment** to begin.
2. Review each message and choose **Delete**, **Archive**, or **Reply / Action**.
3. Continue until all 20 emails are processed to view your report.

## Notes

- The experience is fully client-side and uses the shared µ-shell for consistent navigation.
- Special handling is included for the “Welcome New Hire” and “URGENT!!!” messages to accept sensible non-action outcomes.
