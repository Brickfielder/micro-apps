# Outlook Simulation

An Outlook-style inbox triage assessment where you clear 20 preset messages by choosing whether to reply, archive, or delete. The experience mirrors a desktop client with a ribbon bar, reading pane, and detailed scoring summary.

## How to use

1. Click **Begin Assessment** on the intro modal to start the timer.
2. Review the highlighted message in the reading pane and choose **Reply**, **Archive**, or **Delete** using the ribbon actions.
3. Continue until all 20 emails are processed to view accuracy, total time, and per-message results.

## Notes

- Phishing and policy traps (e.g., "Welcome New Hire" and "URGENT!!!") accept sensible non-action outcomes, matching the built-in scoring logic.
- The layout now includes avatars, selection highlighting, and an end-of-run report table for quick review.
